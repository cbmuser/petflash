New Software for the 6502 ROMRAM-Adapter

It's only the UI without the major Flash-Routine. It will follow or do it by yourself.

Use the ACME-Compiler to build the PRG. The Software reconfigurates itself to the used CBM and shows the possible devices:

Basic 1
Tape for Load and Save

Basic 2
Disk for Load and Save

Basic 4
40 and 80 column 
Disk for Load, Save and Catalog
