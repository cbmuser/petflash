# New Software for the 6502 ROMRAM-Adapter

It's only the UI without the major Flash-Routine. It will follow or do it by yourself.

Use the ACME-Compiler to build the PRG. The Software reconfigurates itself to the used CBM and shows the usable devices:

Basic 1 : Tape for Load and Save

Basic 2 : Disk for Load and Save

Basic 4 : Disk for Load, Save and Catalog, 40 and 80 column 

Drive-access works also with the PetSD-Cardreader.
